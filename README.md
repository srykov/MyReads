# MyReads Project

This was a project that I developed as part of my Udacity [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The project required me to use React to create a bookshelf app that allows the user to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

Udacity provided some the HTML & CSS code to display a static version of the My Reads app. I wrote the javascript and JSX to make the app functional.

## What I Learned
This project gave me an opportunity to practice what I learned in the React Fundamentals course.

Specifically I practiced:
* creating components
* using lifecycle events to fetch & render external data
* state management
* managing app location with React Router

## Getting Started
You can can try the MyReads app out by doing the following:
* Download the source code
* Install all project dependencies with npm install
* Start the development server with npm start
* Go to localhost:3000 in your browser
